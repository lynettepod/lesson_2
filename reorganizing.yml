# Using two top-level keys here to distinguish between English messages and Spanish messages
# Can have as many top-level keys here as you want -- such as one for each language your program supports

# This means we have to grab the language first, then the message:

# 1 | MESSAGES['es']['welcome']

# def messages(message,lang='en')
#   MESSAGES[lang][message]
# end
