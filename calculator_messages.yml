# calculator_messages.yml

welcome: "Welcome to Calculator!"
name: "What's your name?"
valid_name: "Please enter a valid name..can be anything you like:"

# As you can see, it's just a list key/value pairs, almost like a hash.
# Next, we'll parse this .yml file using a module that comes from the
# Ruby standard library.

# To use that module in your file, add require 'yaml' and you can parse
# the calculator_messages.yml file, then save the parsed data into a variable.

# replace this:
# prompt("Welcome to Calculator!")

# with this:
# prompt(MESSAGES['welcome'])

# Your program is now using a configuration file! :)
